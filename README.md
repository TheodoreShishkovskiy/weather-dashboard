## Description
A weather dashboard that was created using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve data for certain cities that are searched by the user. The application uses `localStorage` to store cities that have been searched before and allows users to research those cities without needed to re-enter the info.

**Live application deployed at:  https://theodoreshishkovskiy.github.io/weather-dashboard/**
